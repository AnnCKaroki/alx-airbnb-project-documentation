# Airbnb Clone Backend - User Stories

This directory contains the `user-stories.md` file, which translates the system's use cases into actionable user stories. These stories are written from the perspective of the different user roles (Guest, Host, Administrator) and describe the features they require to achieve their goals on the Airbnb Clone platform.

User stories serve as a valuable tool for communicating requirements between development teams and stakeholders, ensuring that the implemented features deliver direct value to the end-user.
